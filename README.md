> Aidyn RPG - A C++ Text Adventure

>> About The Project

This project represents my first week of learning C++. It was originally inspired by a friendly programming contest and built from scratch.

This game was written entirely in C++ and was instrumental in helping me understand key practical concepts, including:
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Encapsulation
* File I/O for the save/load system
* Modular design using Functions
* Version control with a standard Git workflow
* Basic game design through its branching narrative

>> Plans for the Future

I plan to create another, more advanced text-based game within the next three weeks. This next project will build upon the lessons learned here and demonstrate my continued improvement and commitment to my development goals.
